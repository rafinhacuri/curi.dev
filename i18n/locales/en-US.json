  "experience_p1": "My operational foundation at CBPF is built on the efficient management of the web infrastructure. I have technical expertise in DNS operations (authoritative and recursive), enabling me to manage records and resolutions while ensuring service availability — not necessarily architecting the base structure, but operating it with technical rigor. I manage services orchestrated with Docker and served through Nginx (with HTTP/3 support), maintaining an optimized execution environment. Alongside this, I keep the data layer running on a hybrid MongoDB and Redis architecture, ensuring that both persistence and application caching deliver the stability and performance required.",
  "experience_p2": "Within the security and networking layer, I contribute to the continuous development of the Single Sign-On (SSO) system, centralizing institutional authentication.",
  "experience_p3": "In the development workflow, I strategically leverage the existing GitLab ecosystem. I use CI/CD pipelines and available Runners to ensure continuous integration of my deliverables. My focus is on maximizing these automation tools to run tests and validations, ensuring that code reaches production clean and reliable while preserving a fast release cycle.",
  "experience_p4": "With infrastructure and processes in place, I lead the software engineering efforts focused on modernizing the institutional core. I guide the migration of legacy PHP systems to a robust Go and Nuxt stack. This work involves rewriting critical logic to eliminate technical debt, bringing strong typing, modern security, and high performance into the institution’s daily operations.",
  "experience_p5": "To close the reliability loop, I implemented observability routines that monitor the health of this ecosystem. I use monitoring tools to track container and service behavior in real time, enabling proactive detection of anomalies and ensuring that technological modernization is accompanied by high availability."
