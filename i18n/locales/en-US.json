  "experience_p1": "Since 2023, I have been working in software engineering and, starting in 2025, also in the DevOps area at the Brazilian Center for Research in Physics (CBPF), contributing strategically and continuously to the deep transformation of the institution's digital ecosystem. During this period, I have played a central role in migrating a historically fragmented infrastructure—marked by technological limitations—toward a modern, cohesive, and sustainable computational paradigm capable of meeting contemporary demands for reliability, scalability and data governance. As part of this effort, I led an extensive reengineering process of systems originally developed in PHP 5, coordinating their replacement with architectures built in Nuxt and Go, technologies that offer greater security, predictability and operational efficiency. This modernization not only substantially reduced years of accumulated technical debt but also strengthened the institution’s structural foundations regarding robustness, performance, information security and long-term evolvability. Together, these advances consolidate a more resilient digital environment aligned with modern best practices in software engineering and critical-infrastructure computing.",
  "experience_p2": "I manage the core of the institution’s web infrastructure, operating the main Nginx server — configured for HTTP/3 and running in a Docker-orchestrated environment — with a focus on efficiency, predictability and architectural rigor. At the same time, I administer the data stack composed of MongoDB and Redis, ensuring a persistent and caching layer that is highly stable, coherent and resilient, capable of supporting heavy operational workloads without compromising integrity, availability or systemic performance.",
  "experience_p3": "I develop and maintain the institutional Single Sign-On (SSO) system, designed to unify authentication and strengthen digital identity governance across all CBPF systems. This centralization, supported by modern protocols and cryptographic verification mechanisms, establishes a robust trust point, significantly reducing architectural redundancies and increasing operational security. In parallel, I work with strong technical expertise in configuring authoritative and recursive DNS infrastructures — covering primary and secondary servers — ensuring adherence to international resolution standards, high availability, strict validation policies and redundancy strategies that mitigate systemic risks. Within software engineering, I manage the GitLab ecosystem with emphasis on automation, versioning and continuous integration. Through GitLab Runners, I structure pipelines that implement systematic validations, automated tests and continuous delivery cycles, promoting traceability, reliability and workflows that meet the needs of research and development teams operating in mission-critical environments.",
  "experience_p4": "I play an active role in implementing and maintaining advanced observability and monitoring solutions designed to provide deep operational visibility into the execution dynamics of containers and mission-critical services. These platforms, grounded in modern reliability-engineering practices, allow not only rapid detection of anomalies and mitigation of failures in distributed environments but also rigorous interpretation of behavioral patterns in production systems. This approach enables more precise diagnostic analyses, improves decision-making processes and contributes to the construction of an infrastructure that is resilient, efficient and aligned with institutional scalability and stability requirements.",
  "experience_p5": "Currently, my responsibilities include architecting and improving highly relevant institutional systems, strategically overseeing the web infrastructure that powers CBPF services, and coordinating the full software lifecycle — covering advanced version-control practices, continuous-delivery methodologies and operational orchestration in production environments."
